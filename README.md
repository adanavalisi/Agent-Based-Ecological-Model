# Agent-Based-Ecological-Model
The goal of this project was to create a model of an ecosystem where two species are competing for resources. The main characteristic of the model is the rivalry between species regarding the limited resources available in the ecosystem. Every species will have different nutritional needs as well as reproduction rates. Additionally, the model will include seasonal changes and their influence on the availability of resources. Python will be used as the modeling environment due to its simplicity of use and detailed documentation. You can find the detailed report about the project in the repository.
